# Time Trap

Time Trap is just a personal time keeping app I am writing to practice more python coding and to use for work. It's a command line time keeper using a simple sqlite db. My plan is to have it write your time to JIRA's rest api.

## Installation

Simply run 

```bash
timetrap init
```

## Usage

```bash
timetrap.py start -t <ticket>
timetrap.py stop
timetrap.py -h
```
